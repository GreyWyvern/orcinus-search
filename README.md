# Orcinus Site Search

The Orcinus Site Search PHP script is an all-in-one website crawler and search engine that extracts searchable content from XML, HTML and PDF files at a single, or multiple websites. It replaces 3rd party, remote search solutions such as Google etc. 

Orcinus will crawl your website content on a schedule, or at your command via the admin UI or even by CLI/crontab. Crawler log output conveniently informs you of missing pages, links that redirect, and other errors that you, as a webmaster can fix to keep your user experience tight. Customize your search results by blocking URLs, unlisting pages, or raising/lowering their search priority. You have complete control over the appearance of your search results with a [convenient templating system](https://mustache.github.io/).

Orcinus can generate a [sitemap XML or XML.GZ](https://www.sitemaps.org) file of your pages after every crawl, suitable for uploading to Google analytics. It can also export a JavaScript version of the entire search engine that works with offline mirrors, such as those generated by [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com).
