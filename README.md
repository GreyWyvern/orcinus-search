# Orcinus Site Search

The Orcinus Site Search PHP script is an all-in-one site crawler and search engine. Designed for use with small to medium sized sites without a convenient CMS search feature, it replaces 3rd party search solutions such as Google etc.

Orcinus will crawl your site content on a schedule, or at your command via the admin UI or even by CLI/crontab. Customize your search results by blocking URLs, unlisting pages, or raising/lowering their search priority.

Orcinus can generate a sitemap XML file of your pages after every crawl, suitable for uploading to Google analytics. It can also export a JavaScript version of the search engine that works with offline mirrors, such as those generated by HTTrack.

Requires:
- PHP >= 7.2.x
- MySQL / MariaDB
