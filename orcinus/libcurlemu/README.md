# libcurlemu cURL PHP function emulator

If your PHP installation was not compiled with cURL enabled, you may be able to get the crawler running by using the libcurlemu library. This library will attempt to emulate the normal cURL functions even if the cURL package isn't installed. I can't guarantee it will work, but the script will definitely try!

To install the libcurlemu library follow these steps:

1. Go to the libcurlemu Github repo and download the code as a ZIP package: https://github.com/m1k3lm/libcurlemu
2. Unzip the individual files (not the 'libcurlemu-master' folder) into this directory.
3. Try running the Crawler again via the administration UI.

If you're forced to use this method and still have issues, please let me know by submitting a Github issue for tracking. Thanks!
